He won the 2010 (-1-)Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.(-2-)[5]. He has been
 recommended for the receipt of the (-3-)Bharat Ratna award, in fact it has been speculated that the criteria
 for the award of the (-4-)Bharat Ratna was changed to allow him receive the award.(-5-)[6](-6-)[7] He is also a member
 of (-7-)Rajya Sabha of (-8-)Parliament of India.(-9-)[8] Tendulkar passed 30,000 runs in international cricket on 20
 November 2009. After a two-month break he is likely to return to test arena with the series against New
 Zealand commencing in late August 2012.(-10-)[9]
 
Tendulkar has been honoured with the (-11-)Padma Vibhushan award, India's second highest civilian award, and
 the (-12-)Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, India's highest sporting honour. Tendulkar became the first sportsperson
 and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of (-13-)Group Captain
 by the (-14-)Indian Air Force. He has received honorary doctorates from (-15-)University of Mysore(-16-)[10] and (-17-)Rajiv
 Gandhi University of Health Sciences(-18-)[11] Sachin holds 12th rank in (-19-)ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen
 as of August 2012.(-20-)[12] On 1 August 2012, Sachin Tendulkar was nominated for the ICC People's Choice award
 for the third time.(-21-)[13]
 
Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram
 Vidyamandir (English) High School,(-22-)[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced
 many notable cricketers.(-23-)[22] Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New
 English School in Bandra (East).(-24-)[22] He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park
 in the mornings and evenings.(-25-)[23] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became
 exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-(-26-)rupee coin on the top of the (-27-)stumps, and the bowler who dismissed
 Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach
 would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized
 possessions.(-28-)[24] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period,
 due to his hectic schedule.(-29-)[22]
 
Meanwhile at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. He had become a common conversation
 point in Mumbai cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of
 the greats. Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket
 Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the (-30-)Kanga League,(-31-)[22] and later went on to play for
 the (-32-)Cricket Club of India.(-33-)[25] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the (-34-)MRF Pace Foundation in Madras
 (now (-35-)Chennai) to train as a (-36-)fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler (-37-)Dennis Lillee, who took a world record
 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.(-38-)[26] A couple
 of months later, former Indian batsman (-39-)Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads. "It
 was the greatest source of encouragement for me," Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing
 Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries.(-40-)[27] His season in 1988 was extraordinary, with Tendulkar
 scoring a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run (-41-)partnership in a
 Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against Anjuman-E-Islam High School in 1988 with his friend and
 team-mate (-42-)Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler
 to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not
 out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament.(-43-)[28] This was a record partnership
 in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at (-44-)Hyderabad
 in India.
 
The series was followed by a tour of New Zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in,
 Tests including an innings of 88 in the Second Test.(-45-)[57] He was dismissed without scoring in one of the
 two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other.(-46-)[58] On his next tour, to England in July/August
 1990, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a Test century as he made 119 not out at (-47-)Old Trafford
 in (-48-)Manchester.(-49-)[53] (-50-)Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also
 wrote:(-51-)[59]
  "He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads.
 While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable
 were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without
 difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen."  
Tendulkar further enhanced his development during the 1991â€“1992 tour of Australia held before the (-52-)1992
 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in (-53-)Sydney and 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch at (-54-)Perth
 against a world-class pace attack comprising (-55-)Merv Hughes, (-56-)Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented
 to (-57-)Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."(-58-)[60]
  
Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the (-59-)1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.(-60-)[62]
 He was the only Indian batsman to perform in the infamous semi-final against Sri Lanka. Tendulkar fell
 amid a batting collapse and the match referee, (-61-)Clive Lloyd awarded Sri Lanka the match after the crowd
 began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.
 
After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at (-62-)Sharjah, Indian captain (-63-)Mohammed Azharuddin
 was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and (-64-)Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record
 partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether
 he should bat. Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 29 runs in
 a mere 10 balls. It enabled India post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an ODI. India
 went on to win that match.
 
This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour
 of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. These were characterised
 by a premeditated plan to target Australian spinners (-65-)Shane Warne and (-66-)Gavin Robertson, to whom he regularly
 charged down the pitch to drive over the infield. This technique worked as India beat Australia. The
 test match success was followed by two scintillating knocks in a (-67-)tournament in Sharjah where he scored
 two consecutive centuries in a must-win game and then in finals against Australia tormenting Shane Warne
 once again. Following the series Warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his Indian
 nemesis.(-68-)[63] He also had a role with the ball in that series, including a five wicket haul in an ODI.
 Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising comfortably at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar
 turned the match for India taking wickets of (-69-)Michael Bevan, (-70-)Steve Waugh, (-71-)Darren Lehmann, (-72-)Tom Moody and
 (-73-)Damien Martyn for just 32 runs in 10 overs.(-74-)[64]
 
Tendulkar single-handedly won the ICC 1998 quarterfinal at (-75-)Dhaka to pave way for India's entry into the
 semifinals, when he took four Australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in just 128 balls.
 
The inaugural (-76-)Asian Test Championship took place in February and March 1999. Held just twice, the (-77-)1999
 championship was contested by India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.(-78-)[65] (-79-)Eden Gardens hosted the first match,
 in which Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler (-80-)Shoaib Akhtar. The crowd's
 reaction to the dismissal was to throw objects at Akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. The
 match resumed after Tendulkar and the president of the ICC appealed to the crowd, however further rioting
 meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of just 200people.(-81-)[66] Tendulkar scored his 19th
 Test century in the second Test and the match resulted in a draw with Sri Lanka.(-82-)[67] India did not progress
 to the final, which was won by Pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was
 held to increasing political tensions between India and Pakistan.(-83-)[68]
 
A chronic back problem flared up when Pakistan toured India in 1999, with India losing the historic Test
 at (-84-)Chepauk despite a gritty century from Tendulkar himself. The worst was yet to come as Professor Ramesh
 Tendulkar, Tendulkar's father, died in the middle of the (-85-)1999 Cricket World Cup. Tendulkar flew back
 to India to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against (-86-)Zimbabwe. However, he returned
 with a bang to the World cup scoring a century (unbeaten 140 off 101 balls) in his very next match against
 (-87-)Kenya in Bristol. He dedicated this century to his father.(-88-)[69]
 
Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar
 took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was
 performing poorly. (-89-)Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin
 hai!",(-90-)[72] which translates into: "He won't win! It's not in the small one's destiny!".(-91-)[73]
 
Tendulkar, succeeding Azharuddin as captain for his second term, then led India on a tour of Australia,
 where the visitors were comprehensively beaten 3â€“0 by the newly crowned world champions.(-92-)[74] Tendulkar,
 however, won the player of the tournament award as well as player of the match in one of the games. After
 another Test series defeat, this time by a 0â€“2 margin at home against South Africa, Tendulkar resigned,
 and (-93-)Sourav Ganguly took over as captain in 2000.
 
Tendulkar remains an integral part of the Indian team's strategic processes. He is often seen in discussion
 with the captain, at times actively involved in building strategies. Former captain (-94-)Rahul Dravid publicly
 acknowledged that Tendulkar had been suggesting moves such as the promotion of (-95-)Irfan Pathan up the batting
 order which, although only temporary, had an immediate effect on the team's fortunes. In 2007, Tendulkar
 was appointed vice-captain to captain Rahul Dravid.(-96-)[75] During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England,
 Dravid's desire to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President (-97-)Sharad Pawar personally
 offered the captaincy to Tendulkar.(-98-)[75] However, Tendulkar asked Pawar not to appoint him captain, instead
 recommending (-99-)Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins.(-100-)[75] Pawar later revealed this conversation,
 crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.(-101-)[75]
  Injuries and apparent decline 
Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances
 with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous (-102-)Kolkata Test against
 Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of (-103-)Matthew Hayden and (-104-)Adam Gilchrist, centurions in
 the previous test.
 
In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first test, and 117 in
 the first innings of the second. Then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0
 in the next four innings, getting out to technical "defects" and uncharacteristically poor strokes. He
 returned to form in the last test scoring 41 and 86. However, India lost the series. This might have
 been the beginning of the "decline" phase in his career which lasted till 2006.
 
Tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the (-105-)2003 Cricket World Cup, helping India reach the final. While
 Australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, Tendulkar was given the Man of the Tournament
 award.
 
He continued to score heavily in ODI cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri series involving New
 Zealand and Australia.
 
The drawn series as India toured Australia in 2003/04 saw Tendulkar making his mark in the last Test of
 the series, with 241 not out in (-106-)Sydney, putting India in a virtually unbeatable position. He followed
 up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the test. Prior to this test match, he had
 had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three tests. It was
 no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.
 
Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against Pakistan at (-107-)Multan in the following series. India declared before
 Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he passed the landmark in Tests.(-108-)[76]
 In meeting with the press that evening, Tendulkar stated that he was disappointed and that the declaration
 had taken him by surprise.(-109-)[77] Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad
 taste.(-110-)[78](-111-)[79] After India won the match, the captain Rahul Dravid stated that the matter was spoken
 internally and put to rest.(-112-)[80]
 
Tennis elbow then took its toll on Tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming
 back only for the last two tests when (-113-)Australia toured India in 2004. He played a part in India's victory
 in Mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though Australia took the series 2â€“1.
 
On 10 December 2005 at (-114-)Feroz Shah Kotla, Tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th Test century, against
 the (-115-)Sri Lankans. After this, Tendulkar endured the longest spell of his career without a Test century:
 17innings elapsed before he scored 101 against Bangladesh in May 2007.(-116-)[81] Tendulkar scored his 39th
 ODI hundred on 6February 2006 in a match against Pakistan. He followed with a run-a-ball 42 in the second
 one-day international against Pakistan on 11 February 2006, and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions
 on 13 February 2006 in Lahore, which set up an Indian victory. On 19 March 2006, after scoring an unconvincing
 1 off 21 balls against (-117-)England in the first innings of the third Test in his home ground, (-118-)Wankhede, Tendulkar
 was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd,(-119-)[82] the first time that he had ever faced such flak.
 Tendulkar was to end the three-Test series without a single half-century to his credit, and news of a
 shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity. In July 2006, the (-120-)Board of Control for
 Cricket in India (BCCI) announced that Tendulkar had overcome his injury problem following an operation
 and rehabilitation programme and was available for selection, and he was eventually selected for the
 next series.
 
Tendulkar's comeback came in the DLF cup in (-121-)Malaysia and he was the only Indian batsman to shine. In his
 comeback match, against West Indies on 14 September 2006, Tendulkar responded to his critics who believed
 that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th ODI century. Though he scored 141 not out, West
 Indies won the rain-affected match by the (-122-)D/L method.
 
During the preparation for the (-123-)2007 World Cup, Tendulkar was criticised by (-124-)Greg Chappell on his attitude.(-125-)[83]
 As per the report, Chappell felt that Tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter
 felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career.
 Chappell also believed that Tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. In a rare
 show of emotion, Tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to Chappell by pointing out that no coach
 has ever suggested his attitude towards cricket is incorrect. On 7 April 2007, the Board of Control for
 Cricket in India issued a notice to Tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the
 media.(-126-)[84]
 
At the World Cup in the West Indies, Tendulkar and the Indian cricket team, led by Rahul Dravid had a
 dismal campaign. Tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 ((-127-)Bangladesh),
 57 not out ((-128-)Bermuda) and 0 ((-129-)Sri Lanka). As a result, former Australian captain (-130-)Ian Chappell, brother
 of the then Indian coach (-131-)Greg, called for Tendulkar to retire in his column for Mumbai's Mid Day newspaper.(-132-)[85]
 
During this period from about 2002 to 2006â€“7, Tendulkar's batting often seemed to be a shadow of its
 former self. He was inconsistent, and his big knocks mostly came in sedate, accumulative, uncharacteristic
 fashion. He seemed to have either cut out or lost the ability to play many shots, including the hook
 and pull and many other aerial strokes. He also developed a tendency to go without scoring much for long
 periods and become overtly defensive. While players such as (-133-)Ricky Ponting and (-134-)Jacques Kallis were at
 the peak of their careers, Sachin's seemed to be in terminal decline. There were several calls from him
 to retire. However, after the 2007 World Cup, his career had a second wind and his consistency and form
 returned.
  Return to old form and consistency 
In the subsequent series against Bangladesh, Tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was Man of the
 Series. He continued by scoring two consecutive scores of over 90 in the Future Cup against South Africa.
 He was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the Man of the Series.(-135-)[86]
  
Tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some
 to suggest that he struggles to cope with nerves in this phase of his innings. Tendulkar has got out
 23 times between 90 and 100 in his international career.[(-136-)clarification needed] On 8 November 2007 he
 got out on 99 against Pakistan in an ODI at (-137-)Mohali to the bowling of (-138-)Umar Gul. In the fourth ODI, he
 got out on 97 (off 102 balls with 16 fours) after dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps, falling
 short of another century in ODIs in 2007.
  2007/08 tour of Australia 
In the (-139-)Border-Gavaskar Trophy, 2007â€“08, Tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run
 scorer with 493 runs in four Tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings. Sachin scored
 62 runs in the first innings of the first Test at the (-140-)MCG in (-141-)Melbourne, but couldn't prevent a heavy
 337-run win for Australia. In the (-142-)controversial New Years Test at Sydney, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten
 154 as India lost the Test. This was his third century at the (-143-)SCG, earning him an average of 221.33 at
 the ground. In the third Test at the (-144-)WACA cricket ground in (-145-)Perth, Sachin was instrumental in India's
 first innings score of 330, scoring a well compiled 71, as India went on to record a historic triumph
 at the WACA. In the fourth Test at the (-146-)Adelaide Oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first
 innings, involving in a crucial 126 run stand with (-147-)V.V.S. Laxman for the fifth wicket to lead India to
 a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4. He secured the Player of the Match award.
 
In the One-Day International Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series involving Sri Lanka and Australia, Tendulkar
 became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in ODIs. He achieved this feat against Sri Lanka on 5
 February 2008 at the (-148-)Gabba in (-149-)Brisbane. He started the CB series well notching up scores of 10, 35, 44
 and 32, but could not convert the starts into bigger scores. His form dipped a bit in the middle of the
 tournament, but Tendulkar came back strongly in India's must-win game against Sri Lanka at the (-150-)Bellerive
 Ovalin (-151-)Hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls. He finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120
 balls in the first final,(-152-)[90] and 91 runs in the second final.(-153-)[91]
  Home series against South Africa 
South Africa toured in (-154-)March and April 2008 for a three-Test series. Tendulkar scored a five-ball duck
 in his only innings of the series;(-155-)[92] he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced
 not only to miss the second and third Tests, but also the tri-series involving Bangladesh, the (-156-)2008 Asia
 Cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the IPL.(-157-)[93]
  Sri Lanka Series 
Before the (-158-)touring Sri Lanka for three Test in July 2008, Tendulkar needed just 177 runs to go past Brian
 Lara's record of Test 11,953 runs. However, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of just 95
 runs. India lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a Test series with at least three
 matches.(-159-)[94]
  Return to form and breaking the record 
In the following ODI series against Sri Lanka, Tendulkar was sidelined due to injury. However, during
 the following Australia tour of India, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first
 test before making 88 in the first innings of the second test, thus breaking the record for most number
 of Test runs held by Brian Lara. He also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61. He made a fifty
 in the third test and 109 in the fourth, as India won the series 2â€“0 and regained the Border-Gavaskar
 Trophy.
  ODI and Test Series against England 
Tendulkar was again out due to injury from the first three ODIs of a 7-match ODI series at home against
 England, but he made 11 in the fourth ODI and 50 in the fifth, before the ODI series was called off due
 to the Mumbai terror attacks, the scoreline being 5â€“0 to India.
 
England returned for a 2-match test series in December 2008, and in the first test in Chennai, chasing
 387 for victory, Tendulkar made 103 not out in a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket stand with Yuvraj Singh.
 This was his third century in a fourth match innings, and the first which resulted in a win. This was
 redemption for the Chennai Test of 1999 when chasing 271 against Pakistan, Sachin had made 136 with severe
 back pain and was out 17 runs short of the target, precipitating a collapse and a loss by 12 runs. He
 dedicated this century to the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks. Tendulkar failed in both innings
 in the second test, India won the series 1â€“0.
  2009â€“2010 
In early 2009, India revisited Sri Lanka for five ODIs, as the Pakistan series had been cancelled due
 to the security situation in Pakistan and the attacks in Mumbai. Tendulkar failed to reach double figures
 in any inning, before becoming injured.
 
India's next assignment was an away series against New Zealand, consisting of three Tests and five ODIs.
 In the ODI series, Tendulkar made a 163 not out in the third match, an innings ended by stomach cramps
 that forced him to retire hurt. India made 392 and won easily and won the series 3â€“1. Tendulkar made
 160 in the first test, his 42nd Test century, and India won. He made 49 and 64 in the second test and
 62 and 9 in the third, in which India were prevented from winning by rain on the last day. India won
 the series 1â€“0.
 
Tendulkar rested himself for the ODI tour of West Indies, but was back for the Compaq Cup (Tri Series)
 between India, SL and New Zealand in early September 2009. He made 46 and 27 in the league matches before
 notching up 138 in the final, as India made 319 and won by 46 runs. This was Tendulkar's 6th century
 in ODI finals and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals. India has won all six times
 that Tendulkar has made a hundred in an ODI final.
 
Tendulkar played just one innings in the ICC Champions trophy in South Africa, scoring 8 against Pakistan
 as India lost. The next match against Australia was washed out and he was out with food poisoning in
 the third match against the West Indies, as India were eliminated.
 
Australia returned for a seven-match ODI series in India in October, and Tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and
 40 in the first four games. In the fifth match, with the series tied at 2â€“2, Australia amassed 350/4
 in 50 overs. Tendulkar made his 45th ODI hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. Just when it seemed that he would
 steer India to the large victory target, he paddle-scooped debutant bowler (-160-)Clint McKay straight to short
 fine leg, with India needing 19 from 18 balls with four wickets left. The Indian tail collapsed, and
 they lost by 3 runs, being all out for 347. During this match, Tendulkar also became the first player
 to reach 17,000 ODI runs, and achieved his personal best against Australia, as well as the third highest
 score in a defeat.
 
In the ODIs against Sri Lanka in 2009â€“10, Tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8, as India won 3â€“1.In
 the Test Series, he scored a 100 no out in the first test, which was drawn, and 40 in the second and
 53 in the third test as India clinched innings victory in both tests. India won the series 2â€“0.(-161-)[95]
 
Sachin rested himself for the ODI tri-series in Bangladesh in 2010. In the Tests against Bangladesh, he
 made 105 not out and 16 in the first test, and 143 in the second. India won 2â€“0.
 
In the (-162-)2-Test Series against South Africa, Tendulkar made seven and 100 in the first test and 106 in the
 first innings of the second test. In the course of the second 100 (his 47th Test Hundred) he achieved
 several landmarks, in that he had scored four hundreds in his last four matches and that the hundred
 against South Africa in the first Test was the first at home against South Africa. The century was also
 his hundredth score over 50 in International Test cricket, moving him to 92 international hundreds (Tests
 and ODIs combined). In the second match of the subsequent ODI series, Tendulkar scored 200 not out to
 become the world's first person to score a double century in ODI cricket.(-163-)[96]
   (-164-) Tendulkar's shot to reach 14,000 Test runs. He was batting against Australia in October 2010.   
(-165-)Ian Chappell was not happy with Sachin's performance after India's tour of Australia. He says that Sachin's
 quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance
 on the Tour of Australia. Former India World Cup winning captain and all-rounder Kapil Dev has also voiced
 his opinion that Sachin should have retired from ODI's after the World Cup. Former Australian fast bowler,
 Geoff Lawson, has said that Sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that Tendulkar
 should not delay it for too long.(-166-)[108] The selection committee of BCCI expectedly included Sachin in
 the national test squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand commencing in August 2012.(-167-)[109]
  100th international century 
Tendulkar scored his much awaited 100th international hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh
 in the Asia Cup.(-168-)[110] He became the first person in history to achieve this feat. Incidentally, it was
 Tendulkar's first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said "It's been a tough phase for me... I was not
 thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service,
 everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99 hundreds. It became mentally
 tough for me because nobody talked about my 99 hundreds."(-169-)[111] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed
 to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.(-170-)[112]
  Return To Ranji Trophy (2012) 
After getting out bowled on 3 similar instances against the New Zealand recently and hitting a slump in
 form, the master returned to Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home,in
 a match for Mumbai against Railways on November 2, 2012. All eyes were on Tendulkar, who was playing
 his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009. And he didn't disappoint smashing 137 off 136 balls with 21
 fours and 3 Sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.(-171-)[112]
  Indian Premier League and Champions League 
Tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the (-172-)Mumbai Indians in the inaugural
 (-173-)Indian Premier League (-174-)Twenty20 competition in 2008.(-175-)[113] As an icon player, he was signed for a sum of
 US$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, (-176-)Sanath Jayasuriya.(-177-)[114]
 
In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar
 made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking (-178-)Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL
 season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best
 Batsman and Best Captain awards at (-179-)2010 IPL Awards ceremony.
 
Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored
 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after
 losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.(-180-)[115]
 
In the 2011 IPL, against (-181-)Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Tendulkar scored his maiden Twenty20 hundred. He scored
 100 not out off 66 balls. In 51matches in the IPL Tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest
 run-scorer in the competition's history.(-182-)[116]
    
Former Australian cricket team coach (-183-)John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible
 to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.(-184-)[122] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar
 has a weakness while playing left-arm pace.(-185-)[122] He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004.
 Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting
 style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently due to that fact that, firstly, no batsman
 can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the
 team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career he was a more attacking
 batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. (-186-)Ian Chappell, former Australian player,
 remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".(-187-)[123]
 
Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire in recent times,
 including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips'
 heads, over the last seven or eight years. This has enabled him to remain scoring consistently in spite
 of the physical toll of injuries and a lean period in the mid-2000s. By his own admission, he does not
 bat as aggressively as he did in the 90s and early 2000s, because his body has undergone changes and
 cannot sustain aggressive shotmaking over a long period. He is often praised for his ability to adapt
 to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.
  (-188-)  (-189-) Tendulkar has taken 200 wickets across all three formats of the international game.    
There have been many instances when Sachin's fans have done extreme activities over Sachin's dismissal
 in the game. As per reports by many Indian newspapers, a person hanged himself being distressed over
 Sachin's failure to reach 100th century.(-190-)[140]
 
Some analysts have found that Sachin is the greatest ever cricketer in the world surpassing Don Bradman.
 At home in (-191-)Mumbai, Tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. (-192-)Ian Chappell
 has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle Tendulkar was forced to lead, having to "wear
 a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night".(-193-)[123] In an interview with Tim Sheridan, Tendulkar
 admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of Mumbai late at night when he would
 be able to enjoy some peace and silence.(-194-)[141] Tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking
 site Twitter with the user name sachin_rt since May 2010.(-195-)[142]
  Business interests 
On 2 May, Tendulkar was elected to seat number 103 in the Rajya Sabha.(-196-)[180] He took the oath as a member
 of the Rajya Sabha on 4 June; however he could not take the oath during the budget session due to the
 ongoing IPL.(-197-)[181] "Cricket comes first," Tendulkar said when reporters asked whether he preferred cricket
 to parliament.(-198-)[182] Sachin Tendulkar had been alloted 5 Tughlak Lane bungalow, a type VII accommodation
 in Lutyen's zone in New Delhi. The accommodation was just opposite to that of Rahul Gandhi's residence.(-199-)[183]
 However, he has politely turned down the offer.(-200-)[184]
  (-201-) An innings-by-innings breakdown of Tendulkar's Test match batting career up to February 2008, showing
 runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last ten innings (blue line)   
Tendulkar has also consistently done well in (-202-)Cricket World Cups. Tendulkar was the highest run scorer
 of the (-203-)1996 Cricket World Cup and (-204-)2003 Cricket World Cup. After his century against England during group
 stages of (-205-)2011 Cricket World Cup, he became the player to hit most number of centuries in (-206-)Cricket World
 Cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in World Cup cricket.(-207-)[189](-208-)[190] Tendulkar
 has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in ODIs 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1894 runs, easily
 the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for one day
 internationals. Tendulkar is also one of the very few players who are still playing in international
 cricket from the 1980s. On 24 February 2010, Tendulkar broke the previous world record for highest individual
 innings in an ODI, and became the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.
 He made 200 runs and broke the previous record of 194 runs, jointly held by Pakistan opener (-209-)Saeed Anwar
 and Zimbabwe's (-210-)Charles Coventry.(-211-)[191]
 
He has been (-212-)Man of the Match 13 times in Test matches and (-213-)Man of the Series four times,(-214-)[192] out of them
 twice in the (-215-)Border-Gavaskar Trophy against (-216-)Australia. The performances earned him respect from Australian
 cricket fans and players.(-217-)[60] Similarly he has been (-218-)Man of the Match 60 times in One day International
 matches and (-219-)Man of the Series 14 times.He is the leading run-scorer and (-220-)century maker in (-221-)Test and (-222-)one-day
 international (-223-)cricket.(-224-)[193](-225-)[194](-226-)[195] He is the first player to score a double century in Men's (-227-)ODI cricket.(-228-)[196](-229-)[197]
 He also holds the world record for playing highest number of (-230-)Test and (-231-)ODI matches. Tendulkar is the only
 cricketer to accomplish the feat of scoring a hundred centuries in international cricket which includes
 49 ODI and 51 Test centuries.(-232-)[198] He is also the only player to score fifty centuries in Test cricket,(-233-)[199]
 and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined. On 17 October 2008, when
 he surpassed (-234-)Brian Lara's record for the most runs scored in Test cricket, he also became the first batsman
 to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in that form of the game,(-235-)[185] having also been the third
 batsman and first Indian to pass 11,000 runs in Test cricket.(-236-)[200] He was also the first player to score
 10,000 runs in one-day internationals, and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark
 that has been crossed in ODI cricket history. In the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against
 Australia, Tendulkar surpassed Australia's (-237-)Allan Border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark
 the most number of times in Test cricket history, and also the second ever player to score 11 Test centuries
 against Australia, tying with (-238-)Sir Jack Hobbs of England more than 70 years previously.(-239-)[201] On 24 February
 2010, Tendulkar became the first man to score a double century (200*) in an ODI against South Africa.
 On 8 November 2011, Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in Test Cricket.
 (-240-)Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award, 2008.(-241-)[203] 
Tendulkar sponsors 200 underprivileged children every year through Apnalaya, a Mumbai-based NGO associated
 with his mother-in-law, Annabel Mehta. A request from Sachin on Twitter raised 1.025 (-242-)crore ((-243-)US$186,550)
 through Sachin's crusade against cancer for the Crusade against Cancer foundation.(-244-)[216](-245-)[217] Sachin Tendulkar
 devoted all of nine hours to the 12-hour Coca-Cola-NDTV Support My School telethon on 18 September 2011
 that helped raise  7 crore â€“  2 crore more than the target â€“ for from the creation of basic facilities,
 particularly toilets for girl students, in 140 government schools across the country.(-246-)[218]
