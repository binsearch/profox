	
	we have developed two versions of the browser.
	one is a terminal version and another is GUI version
	
*****************************************	compiling and executing the terminal version ***************************************************************************
	
	when you are in the directory containing the source files execute the following command to compile the program.
	
	g++ -o Tprofox main.cpp
	
	this creates an executable called 'Tprofox'
	
	to execute it run the following command
	
	./Tprofox
	
	the required instruction for in-program navigation will be dispalyed on the terminal by now.
