The Samsung Galaxy S3 follows on from the runaway success that was the [1]Samsung Galaxy S2, which won great
 praise and sold in huge numbers, helping Samsung snag the crown of the biggest mobile phone manufacturer
 in the world.  So the new Galaxy had a lot to live up to. It had to be fast, powerful and feature-packed. Oh, and it
 had to look classy. So, how does it fare?  The S3 has gone big on innovation, with lots of new features the speculation hadnt dreamed of. But the
 first thing you notice is the size. Samsung has shown it can make a success of big screens with the 5.3in
 display on the [2]Samsung Galaxy Note.  But thats not a phone, its a new breed of device somewhere between a phone and a tablet. Rivals like HTC
 had been stretching our mitts with 4.7in display blowers such as the [3]HTC One X. Can the S3 take on HTCs flagship model and is it better than than the [4]Sony Xperia S? And will it have
 [5]iPhone 4S fans defecting to Android? Heres what we thought...
 Samsung Galaxy S3: Build 
The S3 has a 4.8in display and its certainly big. Its a slim phone from front to back so its more manageable
 than you might think, but even so.  Actually, what helps more in terms of comfort is the gloss finish. Its like a smooth, flat worry stone
 that you can roll seamlessly through your fingers. A matte finish wouldnt have felt as good.  Though some will feel that the glossy coat looks a bit, well, plasticky. But it feels appealingly shiny
 and reassuringly solid despite a removable battery.  Where rivals like the [6]Nokia Lumia 900 and HTC One X have maximised battery life by sealing it inside,
 and thus created a flex-free handset, the S3 is pleasingly non-creaky, no matter how you hold it.  Sometimes a new phone is only a gentle upgrade over the last model, but the S3 is streets ahead of the
 S2. Its not quite as slim, though at 8.6mm its just a tenth of a millimetre fatter and it lacks the earlier
 phones bulge.  And its still thinner than the HTC One X, [7]Motorola RAZR Maxx, iPhone 4S and many others. In terms of other
 important stats - its 70.6mm across, 136.6mm long and weighs 133g

Back to the size. If your hands can, er, handle it, the positive consequence is a superbly viewable screen.
   
Video playback on a mobile is always a questionable priority  if you cant watch on a TV, a tablet makes
 much more sense  but with 4.8ins of high-resolution Super AMOLED screen with its vivid colours and contrasty
 blacks, this makes it more of a possibility than before.  The screen resolution is identical to the HTC One X, so the pixels per inch arent quite as high on this
 slightly bigger screen, but both displays look lush and inviting, with this one winning in terms of bright,
 rich colours.
 	
Next [8]Samsung Galaxy S3: Features
Previous1[9]2[10]3[11]Next  As the new top-tier Android phone on the block, the S3 is set to go head to head with the likes of the
 [12]HTC One X, the [13]Sony Xperia S but has it got what it takes to grab the Android crown, and can it turn
 iPhone 4S fans over to Googles OS? We went hands-on with the new phone for a closer look...
 Samsung Galaxy S3: Build 
With a 4.8-inch screen on board, the S3 isnt exactly small. Measuring 136.6 x 70.6 x 8.6mm, the S3 is
 slightly longer, wider and fatter than the S2 (125.3 x 66.1 x 8.49mm), which may prove to bit a little
 on the large side for some although the extra thickness may actually make the S3 slightly easier to hold
 and less likely to slip from your hand, particuarly when taking a photo.  At 133g, the S3 is very slightly heavier than the S2, although only be 3g so if we hadnt have told you,
 you probably wouldnt have even noticed.  The slightly rounded design means that the new phone has more in common with the looks of the [14]Samsung
 Galaxy Nexus than with the S2, although the plastic finish on the back feels more premium than its predecessor.  The S3 has the usual Home button along with Settings and Back touch controls on either side, while the
 front-facing camera has inexplicably moved from the left to the right of the screen.  The brand takes its Inspired by Nature theme through to the finishes - you can choose from Marble White
 and Pebble Blue.
 Samsung Galaxy S3: Features   
There are plenty of new features on board, not least the Smart Stay function which uses eye detection
 to ensure that the screen
 
doesnt dim as long as youre looking at it, which could well be useful, albeit a potential drain on on
 your precious battery life.  Smart Alert means that the phone will vibrate as soon as you pick it up to let you know that you have
 a notification, presumably if looking at the notification light is slightly too taxing for you. Not exactly
 a game-changing feature, but something new, nonetheless.  Another new feature is Smart Call which automatically dials the number youre looking at as soon as you
 lift the phone to your ear when youre in contacts, messages or call log. This sounds like a clever piece
 of technical wizardy (which is based on proximity sensors and motion detection), but whether its useful
 or not will be down to personal preference.  S Voice is essentially voice-activated control that will give you direct access to functions such as the
 camera, calls, text, the alarms, weather, calendar and music and itll even work when music is playing.
 What it wont do is answer you back with pithy retorts, like Apples Siri.  Youll also be able to watch videos in a (very tiny) pop-up screen whlie multitasking in other apps. Were
 not entirely sure what this would be useful for, but video conferencing could be the key here.  Social Tag will instantly recognise faces from pics and automatically offer to text the image to the people
 featured in the image.  All Share PLay enables wireless transfer to all other connected devices while SBEAM will transfer files
 using an NFC connection, although for bigger files youll need to go back to Wi-Fi. And itll only work
 with other Galaxy S3s.
 Samsung Galaxy S3: Screen 
The gigantic 4.8-inch screen is probably the phones most striking feature, and while its an inch bigger
 than that of the HTC One X, its not as square so it doesnt look quite as massive. Its still quite a leap
 from the S2s 4.3-inch screen, while the pixel density has been upped from 218ppi to 306ppi, with a resolution
 of 720x1280 pixels. Once again the screen uses Super AMOLED technology, to keep the viewing angle as
 wide as possible.  Even under the artificial lights of the demo room, we could see that the screen was of excellent quality,
 but weve to try out in bright sunshine.
 Samsung Galaxy S3: Camera 
While many were expecting a 12MP camera to land with the new S3, Samsung has stuck a relatively average,
 but thoroughly decent, 8MP snapper and it will also shoot and play 1080p. Not much has changed since
 the previous model in terms of specs, but there are a couple of new features.  The burst mode takes contiunous shots at a rate of 6fps, and from that the camea will pick the best shot
 based on smile detection, blink detection, contrast and blurring. According to Samsung, the camera has
 zero shutter lag along with an improved shot-to-shot time.
 
Face Slideshow will zoom in all the faces within a picture if youre viewing your pictures in a slideshow.
 Does anyone view their phone-based photos in a slideshow? Were not so sure.  Youll also be able to set up rules for photos to be automatically placed in groups based on faces, contacts
 or location. Theres also Face Zoom which means that you can tap on a face when lining up a crowd shot
 and the camera will zoom in automaticlly. The lack of optical zoom means that this is going to be fairly
 limited, but we look forward to trying it out in the wild.  We cant help but think that some or these features may be overthinking the problem somewhat. We just want
 a camera that offers the best quality snaps possible...  Somewhat curiously, the front-facing cam is 1.9MP compared to the S2s 2MP. While this kind of difference
 will make absolutely no difference at all in practice, it seems a little strange for the specs to be
 going down rather than up. However, the good news is that you can shoot video in 720p and also capture
 stills and the same time that youre shooting video.
 Samsung Galaxy S3: Performance 
The quad-core processor certainly seemed to do the trick in the limited time that we had with the phone.
 There was barely any lag when switching between home screens and firing up apps.  The S3 sports 1GB of RAM (the same as the S2), while the Flash memory is available in 16, 32 and 64 GB
 versions, improving on the S2s 16GB offering, while theres also a micro SD card slot should you wish
 to expand the memory. Theres also 50GB of free storage for your content on Dropbox for the next years,
 which is double what HTC is offering on its HTC One X.
 Samsung Galaxy S3: Battery    
The S3 packs a 2100mah battery, compared to the S2s 1650mah cell. Obviously we havent had our hands on
 the phone long enough determine exactly how much difference this will actually make, the presence of
 a more powerful processor (not to mention all the extra features) will certainly require more juice.
 Samsung Galaxy S3: Verdict 
The Samsung Galaxy S3 certainly looks impressive, especially thanks to the zippy operation that results
 from that quad-core chip.  Some will see the new social, voice and notification features as being compelling reasons to buy the phone.
 Some will see them as an unnecessary drain on the battery and will spend their first few hours with the
 phone deciding which of the features to deactivate first.  Either way, theres no denying that the S3 is a powerful phone that could well be a contender for the Best
 Android Phone crown. Well just have to see how it performs when we get one in for testing at T3 Towers...  Samsung Galaxy S3 availability: 30 May  By use of this code snippet, I agree to the Brightcove Publisher T and C  found at https://accounts.brightcove.com/en/terms-and-conditions/.
